# Goto Usage Scenarios

# Scenario: Use HTTP client to send requests and track results

A very simple use case is to send HTTP traffic to one or more servers for a period of time and collect the results per destination. To add more to it, you may want to send different kinds of HTTP requests (methods, headers), receive same/different response headers from those destinations, and track how the various destinations responded over the duration of the test in terms of response counts by status code, by header, etc.

`Goto` as a client tool allows you to script a test like. You can run multiple instances of `goto` as clients and servers, and then use APIs to:
- configure requests and responses, 
- trigger tests in multiple steps/iterations, and 
- get results

1. Let's use one `goto` client instance and multiple `goto` server instances for the setup. You could run multiple clients as well if needed, to trigger traffic from multiple sources. We'll assume the following URLs represent the running `goto` instances:
   - Client: `http://goto-client:8080`
   - Server 1: `http://goto-server-1:8080`
   - Server 2: `http://goto-server-2:8080`
   - Server 3: `http://goto-server-3:8080`

2. We'll start with two servers as target destinations. It might be a good idea to clear any previously added targets before adding new ones.
    ```
    $ curl -X POST http://goto-client:8080/client/targets/clear
    Targets cleared
    
    $ curl -s goto-client:8080/client/targets/add --data '
      { 
      "name": "target1",
      "method":	"POST",
      "url": "http://goto-server-1:8080/some/api",
      "headers":[["x", "x1"],["y", "y1"]],
      "body": "{\"test\":\"this\"}",
      "replicas": 2, "requestCount": 200, 
      "delay": "200ms", "sendID": true
      }'
   Added target: {"name":"target1","method":"POST","url":"http://goto-server-1:8080/some/api","headers":[["x","x1"],["y","y1"]],"body":"{\"test\":\"this\"}","bodyReader":null,"replicas":2,"requestCount":200,"delay":"200ms","keepOpen":"","sendID":true}

    $ curl -s goto-client:8080/client/targets/add --data '
      { 
      "name": "target2",
      "method":	"PUT",
      "url": "http://goto-server-2:8080/another/api",
      "headers":[["x", "x2"], ["y", "y2"]],
      "body": "{\"some\":\"thing\"}",
      "replicas": 1, "requestCount": 200, 
      "delay": "200ms", "sendID": true
      }'
    Added target: {"name":"target2","method":"PUT","url":"http://goto-server-2:8080/another/api","headers":[["x","x2"],["y","y2"]],"body":"{\"some\":\"thing\"}","bodyReader":null,"replicas":1,"requestCount":200,"delay":"200ms","keepOpen":"","sendID":true}

    #verify the targets were added
    $ curl -s goto-client:8080/client/targets | jq
    ```

    The client allows targets to be invoked with custom headers and body. Additionally, `replicas` field controls concurrency per target, allowing you to send multiple requests in parallel to each target. The above example asks for 2 concurrent requests for target1 and 1 concurrent request for target2. Field `requestCount` configures how many total requests to send per replica of a target. So, target1 with 2 `replicas` and 100 `requestCount` means a total of 200 requests, where 2 requests are sent in parallel, then next 2, and so on. Field `delay` controls the amount of time the client should wait before sending next replica requests. In the above example, the client will wait for 100ms after each pair of concurrent requests to target1. A combination of these three fields allow you to come up with many variety of traffic patterns, spreading the traffic over a period of time while also keeping a certain concurrency level.  

3. With the targets in place, let's ask `goto` client to track some response headers.
    ```
    $ curl -X POST goto-client:8080/client/track/headers/clear
    All tracking headers cleared

    $ curl -X PUT goto-client:8080/client/track/headers/add/x,y,z,foo
    Header x,y,z,foo will be tracked

    #check the tracked headers
    $ curl goto-client:8080/client/track/headers
    x,y,z,foo
    ```

4. The advantage of using goto servers as targets for this experiment is that we can ask those server instances to respond with HTTP error codes some of the times. Let's do just that. You can learn more about this specific `goto` server feature in other scenarios as well as from API docs.
    ```
    $ curl -X PUT Server8081/response/status/set/502:20
    Will respond with forced status: 502 times 20
    
    $ curl -X PUT Server8082/response/status/set/503:20
    Will respond with forced status: 503 times 20
    ```


5. Time to start the traffic. But before that, let's ask `goto` to run the load in async mode without blocking the invocation call. We'll get the results later via another API call.
    ```
    $ curl -X PUT goto-client:8080/client/blocking/set/N
    Invocation will not block for results

    $ curl -X POST goto-client:8080/client/targets/invoke/all
    Targets invoked
    ```

6. While these two targets are running, we add another target. Why? Just because we can.
    ```
    $ curl -s goto-client:8080/client/targets/add --data '
      { 
      "name": "target3",
      "method":	"OPTIONS",
      "url": "http://goto-server-3:8080/foo",
      "headers":[["foo", "bar1"], ["x", "x1"], ["y", "y1"]],
      "body": "{\"some\":\"thing\"}",
      "replicas": 3, "requestCount": 100, 
      "delay": "20ms", "sendID": true
      }'
    Added target: {"name":"target3","method":"OPTIONS","url":"http://goto-server-3:8080/foo","headers":[["foo","bar1"],["x","x1"],["y","y1"]],"body":"{\"some\":\"thing\"}","bodyReader":null,"replicas":3,"requestCount":100,"delay":"20ms","keepOpen":"","sendID":true}
    ```

7. Now we invoke this third target separately. This will start on its own while the previous two were also running.
    ```
    $ curl -X POST goto-client:8080/client/targets/target3/invoke
    Targets invoked
    ```

8. Now we have 3 targets running. Let's stop the first two in their tracks. Why? You know, just because...
    ```
    $ curl -X POST goto-client:8080/client/targets/target1,target2/stop
    Targets stopped
    ```

9. We could do more of these add/remove/stop/start operations on the targets until we get tired. Once we're done, we collect the results

# Scenario: Run dynamic traffic from K8s pods at startup

What if you want to test traffic flowing to/from pods amid chaos where pods keep dying and getting respawned? Or what if you're testing in the presence of a canary deployment tool like `flagger`, where canary pods get spawned on the fly and later get terminated, and you need those canary pods to send/receive traffic.

Sending traffic to such ephemeral pods is straight-forward, but getting traffic to originate from those pods automatically as soon as the pods come up? Clearly that can only happen if you put an application there that starts sending traffic as soon as it starts. But what if that traffic has to be controlled dynamically based on your current testing scenario? It's not a fixed set of traffic that needs to originate from those pods, but instead the traffic changes based on some other external conditions. 

Now it gets tricky, because you need to be able to tell the pod where to send the traffic once it's up. But remember, the pod is not even up yet, flagger is still in the middle on spawning your canary pods. Or perhaps K8s is in the middle of recycling pod. What do you do now? Keep polling K8s for the pod availability, and once the pod is available, connect to it via IP and configure the current traffic configs/targets there so that it can start sending traffic per the current testing requirement? Exactly this is what `goto` can do, but automatically? How? Glad that you asked.

`Goto` has a `Registry` feature, where one or more `goto` instances can act as registry, and other `goto` instances can be configured to connect to the registry at startup. You can configure traffic details at registry, to be passed to all pods based on their labels. As soon as a `goto` instance comes up and connects to the registry, the registry sends it its share of current traffic configs. And some/all of that traffic may be configured to be run automatically. So, as soon as the `goto` instances receive a traffic config from registry and notice that it's meant to be auto invoked, they start running that traffic like there's no tomorrow.

Let's see the APIs involved to achieve this scenario:

1. Let's run one goto instance as registry. We run it on port 8000 and give it a label `registry` just for run. This instance is not meant to send/receive real traffic. Note that there's nothing special about a registry instance, any `goto` instance can act as a registry. Let's assume this instance is available at `http://goto-registry`
   ```
   $ goto --port 8000 --label registry
   ```
2. On this registry instance, we configure some traffic that would be passed on to any `goto` instances that connect to registry with label `peer1`. All these worker instances that connect to registry are called `peers`. In the API below, `peer1` is the label to be used by some such peers.
   ```
   $ curl -s http://goto-registry/registry/peers/peer1/targets/add --data '
      { 
      "name": "t1",
      "method":	"POST",
      "url": "http://somewhere/foo",
      "headers":[["x", "x1"],["y", "y1"]],
      "body": "{\"test\":\"this\"}",
      "replicas": 2,
      "requestCount": 200, 
      "delay": "50ms", 
      "sendID": false,
      "autoInvoke": true
      }'
   ```
   Quite simply, we configured a target for `peer1` instances. Go ahead and add some more for other peers too. Note that this target `t1` was marked for auto invocation via flag `autoInvoke`. We'll see how this plays out soon.

3. Now the basic registry work is done. Time to configure `peer1` instances. This could be a K8s deployment, but for now we'll just look at simple command line examples. A peer instance is passed a couple of additional things as command line args: its own label and the URL of the registry it must connect to.
   ```
   $ goto --port 8080 --label peer1 --registry http://goto-registry 
   ```
   I'm sure you're connecting the dots already by now. This instance is told that it's called `peer1` and it should talk to registry at `http://goto-registry` for further instructions. `Goto` instances are good subordinates, they do as told, so this one will indeed connect to the registry at startup. What's not obvious from above command line example is that if you put these cmd args in K8s deployment's pod spec, all pods of that deployment will automatically fall in line and connect to this same registry with the same label, and hence receive the same set of configs. 
   
   Let's assume that this `goto` instance is available at `http://goto-peer1`
4. Once `peer1` pods are up and running, we can check all of them for the targets they received from registry
   ```
   $ curl http://goto-peer1/client/targets
   ```
   The above API call should show the target t1 that we configured at the registry. Additionally, remember that target `t1` was marked for auto invocation? Let's check the `peer1` instance for some results already at startup.
   ```
   $ curl http://goto-peer1/client/results
   ``` 
   If all goes as planned (which it usually does with `goto`), you should see that the `peer1` instance already ran the traffic as requested in target config `t1` and got some results for you.
5. Nice already, isn't it? But it keeps getting better. Not only `peer1` received the configs at startup, but any new config you add at the registry will automatically get pushed to all registered instances for that peer label. And not just client targets, but also jobs. What are jobs? Well, that's the story for another scenario. Or checkout [Job feature documentation](README.md#jobs-features)


# Scenario: Deal with transient pods

On the subject of transient pods that come up and go down randomly (due to chaos testing or canary deployment testing), testing your application's behavior in the presence of such transiency is challenging. Due to canary deployment or K8S HPA scaling, pods may come up and go down at random points non-deterministically. To be able to perform some deterministic testing among such non-determinism is a challenge. In order to connect the dots and reason about some behavior of a traffic that originates from a non-deterministic source, and receives response from a non-deterministic destination, you'd (or your test harness would) need to know which K8S pod started at what point and shut down at which point.

If `goto` is added as a container to your deployment (or `goto` was the primary container for testing purpose), the `goto` instances can help you record the timeline of your pod lifecycles and correlate it with the test results. 

When a `goto` instance is told to connect and work with a `goto` registry, the instances reports to the registry at startup, periodic pings (every 30s), and reports at death too. Registry `goto` instance serves as the book-keeper of this info, building a timeline of the lifecycle of pods of a deployment as well as container restarts for a pod. The `/peers` API in the registry instance returns the collective results of all the `goto` instances that connected to it.

Let's see it in action to understand it better. Just like previous scenario, we have a registry instance and a `goto` worker instance connected to the registry.

   ```
   $ goto --port 8080 --label registry
   ```
   ```
   $ goto --port 8081 --label peer1 --registry http://goto-registry:8080
   ```

When the `peer1` instance comes up, it registers itself with the registry. After this point, the peer details can be seen on the registry:
   ```
   $ curl -s http://goto-registry:8080/registry/peers
    {
      "peer1": {
        "name": "peer1",
        "namespace": "local",
        "pods": {
          "172.28.255.164:8081": {
            "name": "peer1-host",
            "address": "1.0.0.1:8081",
            "healthy": true,
            "currentEpoch": {
              "epoch": 0,
              "name": "peer1-host",
              "address": "1.0.0.1:8081",
              "firstContact": "2020-08-06T14:48:26.001994-07:00",
              "lastContact": "2020-08-06T14:48:26.001994-07:00"
            },
            "pastEpochs": null
          }
        },
        "podEpochs": {
          "1.0.0.1:8081": [
            {
              "epoch": 0,
              "name": "peer1-host",
              "address": "1.0.0.1:8081",
              "firstContact": "2020-08-06T14:48:26.001994-07:00",
              "lastContact": "2020-08-06T14:48:26.001994-07:00"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
   ```

For a peer (named `peer1` in the example above), registry records the following details:
- `name`: peer's name (governed by the label passed to the peer at startup, or defaults to peer's hostname)
- `namespace`: K8s namespace when peer is running on k8s, otherwise uses `local` by default
- `pods`: list of instances connected to registry using this peer name. For each instance, it records the IP address, port, host name, flag telling whether this instance was found to be healthy at last interaction. `currentEpoch` and `pastEpochs` record the various lifetimes of this instance. If the instance only connects once, there'll just be one epoch shown as `currentEpoch`. If the instance gets restarted without getting a change to de-registre, and reconnects at startup again with the same IP, the old `currentEpoch` is moved to `pastEpochs`, and new epoch is recorded under `currentEpoch`. For an epoch, there's in index that tells the sequence number of this epoch, while `firstContact` and `lastContact` records when this instance connected for the first time, and the last time this instance reminded registry of its presence.
- `podEpochs`: records all appearances of various instances for a peer name. When an instance de-registers, it's removed from the `pods` list but all its past appearances are kept `podEpochs`. These `podEpochs` stay around until explicitly cleaned using API `/registry/peeers/clear/epochs`.

The peer1 instance keeps pinging the registry, reminding registry of its presence. This way, if registry instance restarted for some reason, the instances re-register with the registry. When an instance goes down, it attempts to de-register from the registry. However, sometimes the instance might be unable to de-register (e.g. due to pod running with envoy sidecar, and the sidecar becoming unavailable or being unable to route traffic). When registry receives the notification from the instance about the imminent shutdown, it removes the peer instance from the `pods` list but the instance details remain in the `podEpochs` list. So `podEpochs` records the complete timeline of all pods/instances of a peer. Another example of the list:

# Scenario: Capture results from transient pods

On the subject of transient pods that come up and go down randomly (due to chaos testing or canary deployment testing), another challenge is to collect results from such instances. You could keep polling the pods for results until they go down. However, `goto` as a client testing tool can help with this too just as in the previous scenario.

`Regitsry` feature includes a `Locker` feature, which lets `goto` worker instances to post results to the `registry` instance. `Registry` stores results from various peers using their labels as keys, and below that results are stored using keys as reported by worker instances. Worker instances stream their results to the registry as soon as partial results become available. 

Worker instances use the following keys:
- `client` to store the summary results of their target invocations as a client
- `client_<invocation-index>` to store target invocation results per invocation batch
- `job_<jobID>_<run-index>` to store results of each job run

Let's look at the commands/APIs involved. To a worker instance, we need to pass the following command args:
```
$ goto --registry http://goto-registry --locker true
```
Flag `locker` tells the `goto` instance whether or not to also send results to the registry in addition to getting configs from registry. Naturally `registry` URL must also be passed to the instance, as the instance must connect to a registry first before it can even think about storing some results in the locker.

On the registry side, there's nothing specific needed to tell a `goto` instance to act as registry; any `goto` instance can act as a registry. 

To get all locker results for all peers:
```
$ curl http://goto-registry/registry/peer/lockers
```

To get locker results for a peer:
```
$ curl http://goto-registry/registry/peer/peer1/locker
```

To clear locker of a peer:
```
$ curl -X POST http://goto-registry/registry/peer/peer1/locker/clear
```

To clear lockers of all peers at a registry:
```
$ curl -X POST http://goto-registry/registry/peers/lockers/clear
```

# Scenario: HTTPS traffic with certificate validation

`Goto` client tool can be used to send HTTPS traffic and verify TLS certificates for some targets while skipping TLS validation for some other targets.

To perform TLS cert validation, `goto` needs to be given Root CA certificates. Generally, `goto`'s philosophy is to configure everything via APIs, but there are a few things that must be configured at startup. You saw some of those in the previous scenario (port, label, registry url). Root certificates location is one of them, and for good reason: if some HTTPS traffic must be invoked at a goto instance at startup (as described in previous scenario), it would need the TLS certificates right at startup.

Configuring Root CA certificates location is a simple command line argument:
```
$ goto --certs /some/location/on/local/filesystem
```
`Goto` will look for all files with extensions `.crt` and `.pem` in this directory and add those to a root cert bundle that it'd use later for HTTPS traffic. If no directory is given at startup, it looks at `/etc/certs` by default.

Additionally, for each HTTPS target, you can use the `verifyTLS` field to control whether or not the target's TLS certificate should be verified. Another relevant piece of config is the `Host` header. For non-TLS traffic, `Host` header can be used if you're sending traffic via a gateway/proxy that routes traffic based on host header. For HTTPS traffic, such gateways rely on SNI authority instead of Host header. However, `goto` will look at the `Host` header and put that as the ServerName for SNI identification (SNI stands for `Server Name Indication`, so "SNI Identification" becomes "Server Name Indication Identification"... hmmm, weird.). Let's see an example payload with both `verifyTLS` and `Host` header.
```
$ curl -v http://goto-instance/client/targets/add --data '
{ 
"name": "t1",
"method":	"GET",
"url": "https://somewhere.com",
"headers":[["Host", "somewhere.else.com"]],
"verifyTLS": true
}'
```
This config would lead to HTTPS traffic being sent to `somewhere.com`, but SNI authority set to `somewhere.else.com`, and it would verify the TLS certificates presented by the target server against `somewhere.else.com` host and using the Root CAs read from the command line arg location. Sweet!


# Scenario: Use HTTP server to respond to any arbitrary client HTTP requests


A simple testing need is to have an HTTP application that can respond to some custom REST API calls with a given payload, so that we don't have to write custom code for the server application. You may need such server application during development time, as a stand-in for the real server application that you want to defer building but need it now to build the UI/client. Or, you may need such server application to test some existing client application, to inspect its requests (URIs invoked, headers passed, payload, etc.).

As an http server application, `goto` responds to all arbitrary URI requests, with either default status of 200, or a custom response status you configure. It also logs the details of the incoming requests: HTTP method, request URI, request headers, remote client address, etc. You can set custom response headers to be sent back for all requests, and also custom response payload. You can configure some URIs to bypass the custom response setup, in which case those URIs will respond with the default 200 status. You can even specify a default bypass response status!

Let's see some of these features in action.

1. Let's assume `goto` instance is running at `http://goto:8080`

2. 
- Certain HTTP response codes for a specific number of requests.
- Certain HTTP response headers to be added to each response
- Add a delay to responses 
`Goto` as a server application allows y



# Scenario: Test a client's behavior upon service failure

Suppose you have a client application that connects to a service for some API (`/my/api`). Either the client, or a sidecar/proxy (e.g. envoy), has some in-built resiliency capability so that it retries upon certain kind of failures (e.g. if the service responds with `HTTP 503`). The client or the proxy (e.g. envoy) may possibly even attempt to reconnect to a different endpoint of the service.

This `goto` tool is the ideal tool to goto [yeah, intended :)] to test such resiliency behavior of the client or the proxy, in two possible ways:

1) Run `goto` as a server that the client/proxy sends requests to, and `goto` can be configured to respond with various kinds of responses.
2) Run `goto` as a forwarding proxy layer in front of real server application, let it intercept all the calls and forward those to the server application. When you want to fail the service temporarily, ask `goto` to temporarily respond with a failure code, e.g. `HTTP 503`.

Let's look at the second setup in more details as that's more exciting of the two. 

1. Assume the real service application is accessible over URL `http://realserver`. Currently your client app connects to this server, and you want to test the resiliency behavior between this pair for URI `/my/fancy/api`.

   ```
   curl -v http://realserver/my/fancy/api
   ```

2. Run `goto` server somewhere (local machine, a pod, a VM). Let's suppose the `goto` tool is accessible over URL `http://goto:8080`. You configure the client to connect to goto's url now.

    ```
    #run goto
    goto --port 8080

    #confirm it's responding
    curl -v http://goto:8080
    ```

3. Add a forwarding proxy target on `goto` to intercept traffic for URI `/my/fancy/api` and forward it to real server application at `http://realserver`

    ```
    curl http://goto:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data \
    '{"name": "myServer", "match":{"uris":["/my/fancy/api"]}, "url":"http://realserver", "enabled":true}'
    ```

    Now `goto` will proxy all requests to the server application. Confirm it:

    ```
    curl -v http://goto:8080/my/fancy/api
    ```

4. Reconfigure your client app to connect to this new URL: `http://goto:8080/my/fancy/api`. Client requests will be forwarded to the server with all headers and payload, and response sent back to the client. Some additional response headers are added by `goto` to show that the request was indeed proxied via it. These response headers are described later in this document.

<br/>

5. Now it's time to introduce some chaos. We'll ask the `goto` to respond with `HTTP 503` response code for exactly next 2 requests.
   
    ```
    curl -X PUT http://goto:8080/response/status/set/503:2
    ```
   
    The path parameter `503:2` has a syntax of `<Status Code>:<Number of Responses>`. So, `503:2` tells `goto` to respond with `503` status for next 2 requests of any non-admin URI calls. Admin URIs are the ones that are used to configure `goto`, like the one we just used: `/response/status/set`. You can find out more about various admin URIs later in the doc. 

<br/>

6. Now the client will receive `HTTP 503` for next 2 requests. Have the client send requests and observe client's behavior for next 2 failures followed by subsequent successes.
   
    ```
    curl -v http://goto:8080/my/fancy/api
    curl -v http://goto:8080/my/fancy/api
    curl -v http://goto:8080/my/fancy/api
    ```

<br/>

As this small scenario demonstrated, `goto` lets you inject controlled failure on the fly in the traffic flow between a client and a service for some complex chaos testing. The above scenario was still relatively simpler, as we didn't even test against multiple service pods/instances. We could have run one `goto` for each service pod, and each of those `goto` could be configured to respond with some specific response codes for a specific number of times, and then you'd run your traffic and observe some coordinated failures and recoveries. The possibilities of such chaos testing are endless. The `goto` tool makes is possible to script such controlled chaos testing.

<br/>

# Scenario: Count number of requests received at each service instance (Pod/VM) for certain headers
One of the basic things we may want to track is, to observe a client's or proxy's behavior in terms of distributing traffic load across various endpoints of a service. While many clients/proxies may provide metrics to inform you about the number of requests it sent per service endpoint (IP), but what if you wanted to track it by headers: i.e., how many requests received per service endpoint per header.

The `goto` tool can be used to achieve this simply by putting a `goto` instance in proxy mode in front of each service instance and enable tracking for the specific headers you wish to track. Let's look at the sample API calls with the assumption of two service instances `http://service-1` and `http://service-2`, and a `goto` instance in front of each service, `http://goto-1` and `http://goto-2`.

Clear and add tracking headers to `goto` instances:

```
curl -X POST http://goto-1:8080/request/headers/track/clear

curl -X PUT http://goto-1:8080/request/headers/track/add/foo,bar

curl -X POST http://goto-2:8080/request/headers/track/clear

curl -X PUT http://goto-2:8080/request/headers/track/add/foo,bar
```

The above API calls configure the `goto` instances to track headers `foo` and `bar`. 

Now add proxy target(s) with the relevant match criteria to each `goto` instance:

```
  curl http://goto-1:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data '{"name": "service-1", \
  "url":"http://service-1", \
  "match":{"uris":["/"]}, \
  "enabled":true}'

  curl http://goto-2:8080/request/proxy/targets/add --data '{"name": "service-2", \
  "url":"http://service-2", \
  "match":{"uris":["/"]}, \
  "enabled":true}'
```

Both `goto` instances have now been configured to forward all traffic (URI match `/`) to the corresponding service instances. Now we send some traffic with various headers:

```
  curl http://goto-1:8080/some/uri -Hfoo:foo1
  curl http://goto-1:8080/some/uri -Hfoo:foo1 -Hbar:bar1
  curl http://goto-2:8080/some/uri -Hbar:bar2
  curl http://goto-2:8080/some/uri -Hfoo:foo2 -Hbar:bar2
```

Once the traffic we want to observe has flown, we ask the `goto` instances to give us counts for the tracked headers:

```
  curl http://goto-1:8080/request/headers/track/counts |  jq
  curl http://goto-2:8080/request/headers/track/counts |  jq
```

Header tracking counts results payload from a `goto` instance will look like this:

# Scenario: Track Request/Connection Timeouts

Say you want to monitor/track how often a client (or proxy/sidecar) performs a request/connection timeout, and the client/server/proxy/sidecar behavior when the request or connection times out. This tool provides a deterministic way to simulate the timeout behavior.

<br/>

1. With this application running as the server, enable timeout tracking on the server side either for all requests or for certain headers.

   ```
   #enable timeout tracking for all requests
   curl -X POST goto:8080/request/timeout/track/all

   ```

2. Set a large delay on all responses on the server. Make sure the delay duration is larger than the timeout config on the client application or sidecar that you intend to test.

   ```
   curl -X PUT goto:8080/response/delay/set/10s
   ```

3. Run the client application with its configured timeout. The example below shows curl, but this would be a real application being investigated

    ```
    curl -v -m 5 goto:8080/someuri
    curl -v -m 5 goto:8080/someuri
    ```

4. Check the timeout stats tracked by the server

    ```
    curl goto:8080/request/timeout/status
    ```

    The timeout stats would look like this:

    ```
    {
      "all": {
        "ConnectionClosed": 8,
        "RequestCompleted": 2
      },
      "headers": {
        "x": {
          "x1": {
            "ConnectionClosed": 2,
            "RequestCompleted": 0
          }
        },
        "y": {
          "y2": {
            "ConnectionClosed": 2,
            "RequestCompleted": 1
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
