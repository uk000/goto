# Probes

This feature allows setting readiness and liveness probe URIs, statuses to be returned for those probes, and tracking counts for how many times the probes have been called. `Goto` also tracks when the probe call counts overflow, keeping separate overflow counts. A `goto` instance can be queried for its probe details via `/probes` API.

The probe URIs response includes the request headers echoed back with `Readiness-Request-` or `Liveness-Request-` prefixes, and include the following additional headers:

- `Readiness-Request-Count` and `Readiness-Overflow-Count` for `readiness` probe calls
- `Liveness-Request-Count` and `Liveness-Overflow-Count` for `liveness` probe calls

By default, liveness probe URI is set to `/live` and readiness probe URI is set to `/ready`.

When the server starts shutting down, it waits for a configured grace period (default 5s) to serve existing traffic. During this period, the server will return 404 for the readiness probe if one is configured.

#### Probes APIs
###### <small>* These APIs can be invoked with prefix `/port={port}/...` to configure/read data of one port via another.</small>

|METHOD|URI|Description|
|---|---|---|
|PUT, POST| /probes/readiness<br/>/set?uri=`{uri}` | Set readiness probe URI. Also clears its counts. If not explicitly set, the readiness URI is set to `/ready`.  |
|PUT, POST| /probes/liveness<br/>/set?uri=`{uri}` | Set liveness probe URI. Also clears its counts If not explicitly set, the liveness URI is set to `/live`. |
|PUT, POST| /probes/readiness<br/>/set/status=`{status}` | Set HTTP response status to be returned for readiness URI calls. Default 200. |
|PUT, POST| /probes/liveness<br/>/set/status=`{status}` | Set HTTP response status to be returned for liveness URI calls. Default 200. |
|POST| /probes/counts/clear               | Clear probe counts URIs |
|GET      | /probes                    | Get current config and counts for both probes |
